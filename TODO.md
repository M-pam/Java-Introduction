# TODO

### Restructure OOP lectures

The current order seems to difficult. 
IMHO it will be better to start OOP in the following sequence:

1. Static Methods and reusable code
2. Classes & Properties
3. Classes & Methods
4. Classes & Constructors
5. Access Modifiers etc...

### Separate Solutions that are present in Exercises

It seems that when the students have the solutions in place 
they do not think that hard how to write a peace of code.

Consider moving the solutions on a separate page.

### Generic things to improve

- [ ] Restructure course content and separate Collections if applicable into several lectures
- [ ] Add more tasks to the lectures, students complain they don't have enough tasks
- [ ] Resize images that are too big to fit the lecture so that I do not have to scroll to much when presenting the lecture

### Lecture 1

- [ ] Separate task for scanner
- [ ] Explain comments & scanner

### Lecture 5

- [ ] We haven't gone through methods and class names but we are having Recap of it. 
Maybe it would make sense to substitute it with Strings. Or just start OOP.

- [ ] Homework solutions for `Task 1.4` on matrices

### Lecture 11

- [ ] Remove the polymorphism example with the Bird and Airplane and give a more concrete example
with vehicles, cars, trucks and motorcycles. Also find an appropriate image.

- [ ] Add an example for abstract classes

- [ ] Explain static and dynamic polymorphism

### Lecture 12

- [ ] `Task 4` needs more clarification
    - [ ] add solutions for sub-tasks `3`, `4` and `5`


### Lecture 14

- [x] Explain Buffered Writing/Reading
- [ ] Explain Serializable
- [ ] Examples for Reading files
- [ ] ObjectSerializer explained with examples
- [ ] Solutions for all tasks


### Lecture 15 Generics 

- [ ] tasks 
- [ ] further theory 
- [ ] lower bound super keyword and PECS reference
- [ ] multiple generic parameters
- [ ] difference between generic method and generic class

# Feedback

### Lecture 5
- [ ] Homework explanation is missing
- [ ] The lecture has only 1 task
